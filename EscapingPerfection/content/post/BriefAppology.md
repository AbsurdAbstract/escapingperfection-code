It's ironic that in the process of embarking on this journey, I almost seperated myself from its purpose. To you, the reader, there would've been no difference whether I made this post or held off posting this site for another day. However, holding off the sharing of thoughts is the very thing that goes against this sites fundamental philosophy. Waiting. Hesitating. Perfecting...

I will go into further detail when I have more time to formulate my thoughts. But this project is a process primarily for my own well being. It is a meditation I have devised to stop myself from relying on the pursuit of an ideal for happiness. 

This first message, marks my first commitment to this site, and to its reason. This week, I learn HTML, and hopefully after I gain some basic understanding this page wont look so horrible. 

Till next time,
